**For making changes**
Create a local test branch and also a test branch on the repo on Github. When you have something that you think works,
assign someone else to do a code review. Once someone signs up that the code does what it was written to do, merge the 
code into the existing main branch.

If you're making modifications to the README.md file please use this [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to make changes.
